# Rule34-but...-better-
This is just rule34 but without annoying ads and a better design! This is the first version and this runs on your device not as a website!


# how to use r34bb?
first you need a file manager to make the files and folders termux is also required!
# folders
[folder name]
  > app.py
  > index.html
this is the layout for the files

#termux
in order for it to work you need python
so do pkg install python
then > termux-setup-storage
pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4
last step > cd ~/storage/shared/[folder name]

after puttin everything together and doing everything right do python app.py and r34bb is online (still only for you) in termux it will say the link!
